# Example 1

This is how you document your component.


// Note:

Buttons should be created for a purpose and we should explain the correct way to use each sort of button. Eg. CTA buttons are different from "read more" buttons. 

We should maintain the design flexibilty to allow people to globally change, for example, the colour of a CTA button if they can demonstrate that Red works better than green as this allows us to improve the whole site at once.
