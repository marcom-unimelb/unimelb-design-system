## When to use this component

Dismissable alerts are designed to be used when you want to present users with a piece of textual information - usually with an associated interaction ("click here"), without distracting them for the main content of the page. 

This makes them perfect for situations where a timely annoucement is being made. For example:

* Come to our Graduate Expo on 19 January - Register Now. 
* Complete our short survey to win an iPad
* This page will soon be decommissioned. 
* This page is out of date and will soon be decommissioned. 

Dismissable alerts have the added advantage of being ... wait for it... dismissable. This means that once the user has read the alert, and indicated that indicated that they would like to close it, a cookie is set to make sure that the same alert is not presented to the user again.

### Options

// Todo Do we need to consider offering different styling options in order to allow people to associate a dismissable alert with a campaign (eg. grad campaign blues). Ideally this could be a background colour, link colour, text colour sort of option.
