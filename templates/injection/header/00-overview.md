## A note about the header

// TODO: Make this an alert box once we have the classes.

> This is a mandatory global component that must be included on all sites created on the unimelb domain. As markup for the header is injected into the page, changes made to footer code will be applied globally across all sites using the templates.

// QN: is this the sub-page header, homepage header or both?
// QN: is the statment above accurate?
