## A note about footers

// TODO: Make this an alert box once we have the classes.

> This is a mandatory global component that must be included on all sites created on the unimelb domain. As the footer code is injected into site dynamically, changes made to footer code will be applied globally across all sites using these templates. 

The footer is a mandatory component that establishes trust and authority amongst visitors to our website through it's consistency of display and strong university branding. It acts as a consistent sign off to all of our pages. 

It is also where we store Univeristy-wide disclaimers and policies (for example, our copyright, privacy and accessibility obligations). Also contained in the footer is information about the Universities ABN and CRICIS Provider code and visa information (which we must display). 

The footer also contians elements designed to showcase our lineage (Est. 1853) as well as provide people with a point of contact (at a Univeristy-wide level) regardless of the channel they prefer (telphone, or social network).
