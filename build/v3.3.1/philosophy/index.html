<h2>Creating a representative online space</h2>

<p>Our website is as much a part of the University of Melbourne experience as coffee at 7 Seeds,  lunch at the Vic Market, pizza on Lygon street or your daily tram ride to the office. It is just as important a learning environment as our biggest libraries. It is just as important that it works seamlessly as our lecture theatres and toilets. It is also essential that it is as clean and distinguished as our campus and it’s buildings. In a sense, our website is more important than any of those physical attributes, as it is the vehicle through which our knowledge based institution communicates most of it’s knowledge.  It’s also where our future lies.</p>

<p>The templates exist in order to create a consistent web framework that is both easy for people to use and also encourages the creation of excellent web properties by removing distraction and visual noise in favour of clarity of content, purpose and functionality</p>

<p>This involves radically reconceptualising the purpose of our websites and the content we put on them. It involves questioning the processes that have led us to create sites containing noisy, inefficient designs and content. It involves looking at where the web has been and where it is likely to go. It involves being sensitive and respectful of people's time, attention and the digital environments we provide for them to occupy as well as the physical ones. It also provides us with the opportunity to lead rather than follow.</p>

<p>Further to what is normally considered, doing splendid things online requires the creation of a perfect union between content (images, video, text) and the design framework used to hold it. This means that we need to create systems and guidelines that inform and educate people about truly difficult concepts to master - we need to craft a codex of our collective and codified web knowledge that illustrates the deep connections between the various fields of knowledge.</p>

<h3>The opportunity</h3>

<p>Like removing fast food from a diet and replacing it with more wholesome alternatives, we have the opportunity to create something that removes many of the blights that have plagued our websites - banner ads, unnecessary carousels, pages of links leading to more pages of links - in favour of considered executions that achieve the same purpose without disrupting the user experience.</p>

<p>We also have the opportunity to introduce the concept of adaptive flux to our websites through the templates. From a visual and content perspective, this means that a website can display itself differently based off what we know about you, or your specific context - for example, if you are a student, student based content should be prioritised. If you are reading at night time, the design should be modified to make it easier on your eyes (e.g. light text on dark background at night as opposed to dark text on light background during the day). These are the sorts of considerations that will make our website truly magnificent when compared to other websites. It sounds lofty, but it is possible.</p>

<p>In reality, the web moves too fast for us to document a set of requirements for the templates. They cannot be created statically and then fixed. To be a truly useful tool, they must continuously evolve.</p>

<p>At their core, the templates aim to remove the need for people building websites for the university to expend their effort designing pages, coding them, making them accessible, deciding what colour goes with what. If you want this sort of challenge, we suggest becoming a freelance designer or developer who gets to work for a range of clients, or working to challenge the templates by contributing working solutions to the problems you find or weaknesses you perceive. Your contributions will be welcome, going rogue will not as this robs others of the chance to benefit from your contributions. It also fractures our website over time.</p>

<p>The skill required to be a successful web professional at the University lies not in determining how to technically build a website, but in determining why a website exists in the first place. Finding the best way in which you can communicates what needs to be communicated in a way that is absorbed by the visitor.</p>

<h3>How do they work?</h3>

<p>The templates are available for use at three levels. Each level is supported by documentation that provides recommendations and instructions for use.</p>

<p><strong>Global features</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Flux</li>
<li>Banner killer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Page types</strong></p>

<p>Page types are designed to provide pre-made templates to enable the construction of 95% of the pages on the unimelb website. Each page type comes with several variants and is designed to achieve a specific objective. By using consistent page types across the university domain we achieve consistency which in-turn aids in the usability of our site.</p>

<p>Page types fit into two categories, navigational pages and content consumption pages. Content should be kept to a minimum on navigational pages and navigation should be kept to a minimum on content pages. This is an intentional design decision to avoid situations like <a href="http://dl.tagell.com/image/2q2C2f09390R">this</a> where pages are an cognitively-difficult mix of navigation and content. This removes  a sense of direction and purpose from pages and is one of the key problems with our current site and something that we are desperately trying to change using the new templates.</p>

<p>The page types here are designed to lead the user through the content on the page from left to right, top to bottom (for localisation for people from arabic languages, these templates can also be modified to add a right-to-left ordering). You will always find the titles and overviews in the top left, followed by a clean centre column which achieves the state purpose of the page type, followed by any relevant next steps or metadata.</p>

<p><strong>Modules</strong></p>

<p>Modules are used to create page types and include things like news widgets, twitter widgets, opening hour blocks - common design patterns that are used throughout our website over and over again. By making these consistent and flexible, we are able to re-use them across various page types. In the event that a page type does not serve the specific need required, they make it possible to customise a page type to meet your specific needs.</p>

<p>Modules can incorporate specific advanced functionality requiring javascript (eg. news feeds rely on on API or RSS feeds).</p>

<p>Modules come with detailed instructions about how to fill them with content. For example, a page feature banner is only as effective as the copy, video or imagery inserted into it. For this reason, some modules have strict word length or image size restrictions. Many also incorporate advanced techniques that ensure a the module works across various devices (for example, our mapping module requires a static image for mobile views. This static image is replaced when a user interacts with the image in order to save bandwidth on the mobile device).</p>

<p><strong>Elements</strong></p>

<p>Elements are the smallest components available - the vast majority of web developers at the university should never need to use element level pieces, especially if you are using a supported CMS.</p></section></div><div class="no-js" id="sitemap" role="navigation"><h2>Web.Unimelb</h2><ul><li><a href="/content-creators">For Content Creators</a></li><li><a href="/designers">For Designers</a></li><li><a href="/getting-started">Getting started</a></li><li><a href="/layouts">Page Templates</a></li><li><a href="/components">Component reference</a></li></ul><ul class="meta"><li><a href="https://github.com/marcom-unimelb/unimelb-design-system/issues">Report an Issue</a></li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
