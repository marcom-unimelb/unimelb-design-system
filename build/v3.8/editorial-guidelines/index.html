Simple, clear language is always a good starting point.</li><li>In-house jargon will confuse and confound a reader, thus guaranteeing they stop reading your piece and move onto the next one. So keep it out.</li><li>Quirkiness, in the right context, is good as it brings life and humour to a story. The quirk does not have to be in the story, it can be in the headline, picture or even the caption.</li><li>The old adage of a picture is worth a thousand words is still applicable. The digital medium, with high-resolution screens on all devices, gives us a great opportunity to showcase pictures with wow factor not yet seen by a wider audience. The halo effect on the accompanying story is huge. The same applies to videos.</li><li>Graphics are an essential part of Pursuit. Done well a graphic will give readers clarity and understanding in a way that words cannot.</li><li>Flag any potential legal issues or areas of conflict with the Pursuit editors early for advice and direction.</li></ul><h2 id="toneofvoice">Tone of voice</h2><p>Pursuit is a story-telling platform, so facts come first. Opinion is welcome, but it must be informed by a strong knowledge base.</p><h2 id="names">University names and disciplines</h2><h3>We are a university first, academic divisions second:</h3><p>When identifying the source of comments or a location of an event or similar, ALWAYS refer to the University of Melbourne first and include faculty or departmental information subsequently and ONLY in enough detail to sufficiently identify context for your reader, not to demonstrate organisational structure (readers don’t really care).</p><p><em>University of Melbourne drama education lecturer John Smith said….</em></p><p><strong>NOT:</strong> <em>John Smith is Lecturer in Drama Education, located in the Melbourne Graduate School of Education, in the University of Melbourne’s Faculty of Education. He said….</em></p><h3>The University as a substantive pronoun and capitalisation – moderation in all things:</h3><p>Where you write University as a substantive pronoun (meaning, the briefer form is a stand in for the full title of the University of Melbourne) capitalise the U. Where it is referring to universities in general use lower case u.</p><p><em>The University recently underwent an organisational restructure<br />Every Australian university operates in an uncertain political environment</em></p><p>Be careful also not to over-capitalise study disciplines or roles. Excessive capitalisation impairs the flow of meaning for a reader and will cause them to disengage. It can also seem over-formal and potentially pompous. Capitalise ONLY names, titles and proper nouns, and disciplines where they are a part of the name of an organisation unit or job title.</p><p><em>He is from the Department of Economics<br />She is studying history, mathematics and French.</em></p><h3>Universityisms – scholarly traditions:</h3><p>Alumni is gradually replacing all the following various gendered and technically correct forms, however as a prestigious, traditional university, we should use the following:</p><p><em>Alumna</em> – a female graduate<br /><em>Alumnus</em> – a male graduate<br /><em>Alumnae</em> – two or more female graduates<br /><em>Alumni</em> – two or more graduates, either all male, or both male and female</p><p><em>Graduates</em> are people who have graduated<br /><em>Graduands</em> are those involved in graduation ceremonies, before conferral<br /><em>Conferring of Degrees</em> is what happens during a graduation ceremony<br />When presented to the Chancellor for conferral, graduands are called <em>candidates for conferral.</em><br /><em>Testamur</em> is the certificate graduates receive, not a diploma. A diploma is one type of qualification a student earns in order to be eligible to receive their testamur (!).<br />A <em>cohort</em> is the group of students engaged in studying either the same year of their studies, or the same course or program.</p><p><em>Freshman</em>, mostly in the form <em>freshers</em>, is increasingly entering Australian usage from the North American three-year college system. It refers to first year students. Sophomore and senior are much less common in Australia but refer to second and third year students respectively.  Use freshers sparingly. Don’t use sophomore or senior. Typical Australian usage refers to first, second, third years of particular degrees. Fourth year, however, is an Honours year.</p><p><em>He’s a second year JD student.</em><br /><em>She’s doing Honours in science.</em></p><h4>PhD</h4><p>PhD degrees are also known as higher degrees. When they consist only of research as opposed to coursework, they are known as Research Higher Degrees (RHDs). Students studying for the degree Doctor of Philosophy are technically doctoral candidates, but can also be referred to as PhD students, which makes much more sense to uninitiated readers.</p><h4>D Litt v D Litt (<em>Honoris Causa</em>)</h4><p>When someone who already has a PhD conducts a separate body of research equivalent to a PhD they may earn a Doctor of Letters (D Litt). The D Litt is often conferred on eminent people in recognition of contributions to public life who may or may not already have tertiary qualifications: in these conditions it must be referred to as an Honorary Doctor of Letters or an Honorary Degree. It’s a means of acknowledgement, not a qualification.</p><h4>Postgraduate</h4><p>Undergraduate students are clearly those who have not yet graduated with a university degree. Postgraduate students already have a bachelors degree and are embarked on further study, however the programs postgraduate students study can be either graduate or postgraduate degrees or diplomas, and mean the same thing.</p><h3>Tone of voice – be (a bit) humble:</h3><p>Criticisms of the University’s publications in the past have indicated that readers find there to be too much ‘spin’ and too much ‘triumphalism.’ While clearly we want to tell good news stories, avoid overplaying your hand. Aim for a positive rather than triumphal tone.</p><p>Use very sparingly: <em>World first, world class, state of the art, breakthrough, world famous, internationally acclaimed</em></p><p>Prefer: <em>leading, expert, highly regarded</em></p><p>While we don’t wish to seem pompous or take ourselves too seriously, we want to preserve the right amount of gravitas. Do use a light tone, and pose questions, but don’t be quirky, sensationalist or clickbaity.</p><h3>Troublesome names to watch – the anomalies of convention:</h3><ul><li>Australian Labor Party (not Labour – reflects the historical impact of the American labour movement on establishment of Australian Labor Party. UK uses British Labour Party.)</li><li>World Health Organization (uses American z not s because it’s an official name)</li><li>As an adjective use Anzac not ANZAC (following Australian War Memorial convention). Anzac Day, Anzac biscuits.</li><li>Use ANZAC when referring to those deployed during WW1 under joint Australia/NZ military command.</li></ul><h3>Using acronyms – make sure your reader understands you:</h3><p>As a rule, place an acronym in brackets after the full name of an organisation in initial usage, and then refer to it by the acronym only.</p><p>It’s fair to assume that acronyms commonly and widely used as the name of the organisation don’t always need to be spelled out, but only do this with genuinely widely used names that can’t be confused. Examples are: CSIRO, OECD, APEC, UNICEF, ALP, AFL, ABC, LGBT.</p><p>Don’t assume readers are familiar with acronyms specific to disciplines, faculties, or affiliates: Royal Children’s Hospital (RCH), International Baccalaureate (IB), Group of Eight (GO8).</p><h3>Words to watch – be contemporary and inclusive:</h3><p>Avoid choosing words sounding too old-fashioned as they may distract the reader.</p><p><strong>Do NOT</strong> use words with any exclusive or pejorative connotations.</p><ul><li><em>Partner</em>, not husband or wife</li><li><em>Amid</em>, while, not <em>amidst</em>, whilst</li><li><em>Program</em> not <em>programme</em></li><li><em>Fewer and Less</em>. Use fewer when referring to items that can be counted individually. Use less in reference to a reduced number of items that cannot be divided into smaller parts.</li><li><em>Their</em> is in common usage where his or her would have been used. It’s also often preferred where gender disclosure is not desired.</li><li><em>Indigenous</em> or <em>Aboriginal</em> (always capitalised), <strong>never Aborigine</strong>, and make sure geographically and/or culturally specific terms such as Koori are used correctly.</li><li>If Indigenous people provide their clan and/or language group names as identifiers, such as, ‘Professor Ian Anderson is a Palawa Trowerna man from the Pyemairrenner mob in Tasmania’ use it. <em>First Australians</em> is increasingly being used and is preferred by many.</li><li>Use <em>black</em> or <em>blackfella</em>, <em>white</em> or <em>whitefella</em>, mob or other words spoken by Indigenous Australians if you’re reporting quotes. Otherwise don’t use them if they are not language culturally appropriate to the writer.</li><li>Indigenous north Americans are known at <em>First Nations people</em>, or <em>Inuit</em>, <strong>never Indians, American Indians or Eskimos</strong>.</li><li>Avoid using the term tribal. Prefer traditional societies or cultures.</li><li>Avoid ethnic. Use, for example, ‘of Greek ethnicity’ or ‘Greek Australian’.</li><li>Latin Americans, never Hispanic (which is exclusive of Portuguese speakers in South America)</li><li>Immigrants are those coming into a country permanently, emigrants are those leaving, migrant is someone who moves about. Migrant is also often used to described immigrants who have settled in a place, but historically has some pejorative connotations and is best avoided.</li><li>Sex/Gender distinction: sex refers to a person’s biological reproductive characteristics, gender is socially constructed or culturally assigned. Prefer gender, as referring to a person’s sex is exclusive of those who are transgendered.</li><li><em>Disabled</em>, <em>handicapped</em>, and <em>normal</em>, are all judgement calls on people’s characteristics and abilities. Disabled is better than handicapped, but prefer <em>special needs</em> or even <em>differently abled</em>. Prefer <em>typical</em> over <em>normal</em>. <strong>NEVER use the word retarded</strong>, other than clinically.  <em>Birth abnormalities</em>, never defects, etc.</li><li>Refer to diseases or syndromes carefully: Down syndrome (not Down’s), Alzheimer’s disease (not Alzheimer’s). Caps in disease names usually signal the disease is named for the identifier.  Otherwise use lower case. <em>Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy</em>, but <em>muscular dystrophy</em>.</li><li>A person <em>has diabetes, asthma etc</em>, not suffers from (they may feel fine) and <strong>isn’t a diabetic, asthmatic etc</strong> (they are also other things).</li></ul><h2 id="introducing">Introducing people – minimalism respects your reader</h2><p>Give an individual person’s first and last name, with their organisation and job name, in the first instance, and thereafter use their title and last name.</p><p><em>Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne Glyn Davis wished all staff a safe holiday.</em></p><p><em>“I hope you enjoy your holidays,” Professor Davis said.</em></p><p>To include Professor in the first sentence would appear overly formal, and would be more suitable for instance in an invitation, or printed order of proceedings.</p><p>Where the person’s job name and organisation details are very long and are not crucial to your readers’ understanding of the story, chunk this information up and introduce the person for what they are rather than their job name where possible, then place the official information at the end of the story.</p><p><em>University of Melbourne immunologist and Nobel Laureate Peter Doherty said he was heartened by breakthroughs in medical science.</em></p><p><em>“I love science,” Professor Doherty said.</em></p><p>And at the end of the story:</p><p><em>Peter Doherty is Laureate Professor of Immunology at the University of Melbourne and Head of Research at Duke University Children’s Hospital, in Texas. He won the Nobel Prize for Medical Research in 19xx.</em></p><p>NEVER include honorifics (His Excellency, the Honourable etc), postnominals (AC, AO, MP etc) or other styles when referring to people, but do give suitable titles. The intention is simply to identify the person so your reader knows to whom you are referring, not to tick etiquette boxes.</p><p><em>Crown Princess Mary of Denmark</em><br /><em>not Her Royal Highness Crown Princess Mary of Denmark</em></p><p><em>Federal Education Minister Christopher Pyne</em><br /><em>Not, The Honourable Mr Christopher Pyne MP, Australian Government Minister for Education</em></p><h3>Referring to our students – avoiding a power imbalance:</h3><p>Referring to students in stories can be tricky.  Oftentimes they are still very young people, and referring to them as Mr or Ms seems awfully formal, especially if they are high school students attending events or receiving accolades as part of engagement programs etc.</p><p>However, it is usually the case that we are mentioning students in stories where eminent academics are also referenced, and a striking imbalance of power and respect can arise if we use titles and last names for some people, and first names alone for others, based on hierarchies of seniority.  In such cases, offering students the respect of using more formal titles addresses this imbalance.</p><p>If it just looks too weird, manoeuvring your copy so you can reference the student with both their names and thereafter use he or she is the best action.</p></section><hr /><section><p class="center"><a class="button-hero" href="/using-images">Next: Choosing and using images</a></p></section></div><div class="no-js" id="sitemap" role="navigation"><h2>Web.Unimelb</h2><ul><li><a href="/content-creators">For Content Creators</a></li><li><a href="/designers">For Designers</a></li><li><a href="/getting-started">Getting started</a></li><li><a href="/layouts">Page Templates</a></li><li><a href="/components">Component reference</a></li></ul><ul class="meta"><li><a href="https://github.com/marcom-unimelb/unimelb-design-system/issues">Report an Issue</a></li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
