# Getting started

The unimelb design system has been created understanding that in order to make great websites you need to get everything right, not just the code. 

With that in mind, this site provides resources for three (and eventually more) audiences - [content producers](/content_creators), [designers](/designers) and [developers](/developers). 

If you fit into one of those categories, that's where we recommend you start, however feel free to look around.
