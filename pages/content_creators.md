# For Content Creators

This design system has been developed to place emphasis on content so that it is more easily consumed. 

The focus on content means it is even more important that you source the right imagery, text and video for each page on your site. 

Where appropriate, each page template and component in the system comes with corresponding guidelines around:

* Content length
* Guidelines for image selection (including suggested attributes and dimensions)

We have also collated a range of documents here around creating great content for the web.
