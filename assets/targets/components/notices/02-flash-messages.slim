p Flash messages are notices that are placed at the top of the page, just below the header. They span the whole width of the page (except when an in-page navigation is used) and are useful, for instance, for displaying the result of a form submission (when Ajax is not available). Like notices, flash messages come in four variants, but their markup is slightly different (see example below):

ul
  li: code
    | flash--success
  li: code
    | flash--info
  li: code
    | flash--warning
  li: code
    | flash--danger

p On some layouts, the alignment of the flash message's content on wide screen is not optimal. Two classes are available to deal with this situation: <code>flash--center</code> to centre the content, and <code>flash--keep-left</code> to keep the content against the logo on a <code>headerless</code> page.

p You can place the code of the flash message anywhere inside <code>&lt;div role="main"&gt;</code>. It is moved automatically to the right location when the page loads. If multiple messages are found, only <strong>the first one</strong> is moved. This page demonstrates the use of an <em>informative</em> flash message, as well as the behaviour of the <code>flash--center</code> class:

.flash.flash--info
  p <strong>Success!</strong> This is an example of a flash message.

.flash.flash--info.flash--center
  p <strong>Success!</strong> This is an example of a centred flash message.
