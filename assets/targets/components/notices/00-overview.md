## Overview
Notices are a great way to provide contextual feedback alerts for typical user actions. There are four alert types to choose from depending on the level of importance:

 - <code>alert-success</code>
 - <code>alert-info</code>
 - <code>alert-warning</code>
 - <code>alert-danger</code>

Notices may contains links, as shown in the third example below.
