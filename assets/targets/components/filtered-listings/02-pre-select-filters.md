<h2 id="pre-select-filters">Pre-select filters</h2>

Filters can be pre-selected on page entry by adding <code>?filter=label</code> to the URL, where <b>label</b> is the <b>tag</b> ("colour category" from above) eg. <a href="?filter=category-b">Load this page with category B tags pre-selected</a>.

The <b>section</b> can also be pre-selected by using <code>?section=label</code>, eg. <a href="?section=section3">Section 3</a>, or combine them as you would a normal querystring <a href="?filter=category-b&section=section3">?filter=category-b&section=section3</a>

Please ensure that <code>&amp;</code> characters are URI encoded if you need to use them! (eg. replace <code>&amp;</code> with <code>%26</code>).
