<h2 id="fancy-controls">Fancy controls</h2>

If you have complete control over the <code>form</code> markup in your site, a more consistently styled solution can be activated by adding <code>class="fancy-controls"</code> on the <code>form</code> container. These controls are visually consistent across all supported browsers and platforms, unlike the defaults above.
